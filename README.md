# Sentiment-analysis-RNN-on-Hong-Kong-tweets
I performed a sentiment analysis on tweets focused on the HK's protests that took place in summer 2019 while I was doing an internship there.
I develop on python code a recurrent neural network in order to analyze positive or negative opinion about the protests. Twitter API enabled me to source tweets directly from Twitter and then I exploited LSTM algortihm in order to carry out results.
In addition to markdown pdf file with python code, I reported below the ppt which bolstered the correspondent presentation I gave on this project in order to fulfill a master's course homework.
